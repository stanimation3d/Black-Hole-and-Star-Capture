# Black Hole and Star Capture
The scene is the first iconic video game developed by Dünya. In this 2D video game, our goal is to capture a star that moves randomly in random locations, playing as our character, a black hole. Each capture earns us a bonus of 1 point. We also have an enemy that constantly follows us, a white hole. The more points we collect, the faster our enemy follows us. Once we're caught, it's game over. When I explained the game, it felt strange because I mentioned objects directly related to space. If I had just said "our character" and "our enemy," you would have understood it better. Frankly, the gameplay is very simple. We have ready-made executable files in the "Releases" section, but you can read the "manual.md" file for even more flexibility.
